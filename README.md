Welcome to **tokenGo**, a repository where I share small utility developed in Go, to generate token, password and others.
These projects are primarily created as part of a **learning**, **experimental** and **personal** use initiative.

## Features

### CLI

A CLI application for testing and playing with the utility.

### Utility

- **password**: Package password provides a library for generating random password strings.

## :art: Inspirations

These projects are driven by curiosity and a desire to learn. Ideas are drawn from tutorials, open-source projects, and personal experimentation.
